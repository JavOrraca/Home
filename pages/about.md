Welcome to my GitHub! My name is Javier ("Jav") Orraca and I recently graduated from a data science and business analytics masters program at the University of California, Irvine. This new STEM-certified Masters of Science degree is a hybrid business and data science program enabling us to support our digitally driven world.

My career includes over a decade of data analysis and financial modeling for [EY](https://www.ey.com/en_gl/transactions), Pacific Gas & Electric ([PG&E](https://www.pge.com/en_US/about-pge/about-pge.page)), and [KPMG](https://tax.kpmg.us/services/valuations.html), supporting the M&A deal cycle, financial forecasting, and corporate strategy. I can confidently say that I've never been more excited and passionate about a career pivot, and I'm humbled to be part of the data science community, continuously learning, networking, and sharing best practices around programming, advanced statistical analyses, data visualizations, machine learning, and data analyses techniques.

I started this GitHub site to share interesting projects, but as the months progressed and school became more hectic, this GitHub morphed into my data sandbox with interesting content likely most relatable for data science students, analytics practitioners, or corporate executives interested in learning how data science could benefit their business. My [blog](https://javorraca.github.io/Home/pages/blog.html) is regularly updated, and I try to keep the [Resources](https://javorraca.github.io/Home/pages/resources.html) page fresh. I just recently launched [Scatter Podcast](https://soundcloud.com/scatterpodcast), a data podcast packed with career tips and insights from data scientists. My mission is to provide practical insights and resources on business intelligence, data science, programming, and data storytelling.

The easiest way to contact me is [through my Gmail](mailto:orraca.javier@gmail.com) or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/orraca/). If you have any questions or want to collaborate on some projects, I'd be happy to chat!
