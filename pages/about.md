Hi folks, my name is Javier Orraca and I'm a Business Analytics masters student at the University of California, Irvine. This new STEM-certified Masters of Science degree is a hybrid business and data science program enabling us to support the digitally driven world we share.

My career includes over a decade of experience in data analysis and financial modeling for [EY](https://www.ey.com/en_gl/transactions), Pacific Gas & Electric ([PG&E](https://www.pge.com/en_US/about-pge/about-pge.page)), and [KPMG](https://tax.kpmg.us/services/valuations.html), supporting the M&A deal cycle, corporate finance, and internal and external stakeholders. I can confidently say that I've never been more excited and passionate about a career pivot... Advanced statistical analyses, data visualizations, machine learning, and artificial intelligence, this is very much a thing of TODAY and I can't wait to make a difference with the conceptual knowledge and technical skills that I am gaining.

While this site is an obvious plug for my projects and interests, I also want it to be a community repository of solid resources and career information for anyone interested in data science (students, beginners, practitioners, business managers, executives). I'll continuously update my Blog and Resources pages, and Scatter Data Podcast will be launched soon... all of these were designed with the intent to provide more insight into the topics of business intelligence, data science, programming,and data storytelling.

The easiest way to contact me is [through my email](mailto:orraca.javier@gmail.com) or [via LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/orraca/) if you have any questions or want to collaborate on projects.
