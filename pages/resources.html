title: Resources
---

<p>Below is a list of data science resources to introduce you to the world of data analytics, data science, and programming. I&#39;ll update periodically as I learn of new resources and tools. R, Python, and SQL are programming languages used for data collection, data manipulation, data analytics, statistical analysis, web scraping, machine learning, and artificial intelligence. If you have any suggestions, send me a note at <a href="&#109;&#x61;&#x69;&#x6c;&#x74;&#x6f;&#x3a;&#x67;&#105;&#116;&#x68;&#x75;&#98;&#x40;&#101;&#110;&#99;&#x72;&#x79;&#x70;&#116;&#x6d;&#101;&#46;&#x33;&#x33;&#x6d;&#x61;&#x69;&#x6c;&#46;&#99;&#x6f;&#109;">&#x67;&#105;&#116;&#x68;&#x75;&#98;&#x40;&#101;&#110;&#99;&#x72;&#x79;&#x70;&#116;&#x6d;&#101;&#46;&#x33;&#x33;&#x6d;&#x61;&#x69;&#x6c;&#46;&#99;&#x6f;&#109;</a>, thanks.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Eremenko, Kirill. <em>Confident Data Skills: Master the Fundamentals of Working with Data and Supercharge Your Career</em>. Kogan Page, 2018.</p>
<ul>
<li>From the creator of Super Data Science, this was an easy &quot;for fun&quot; read, light math, and provides an overview of data analytics and careers in this field. I swear I&#39;m not on Kirill&#39;s payroll(!)... he&#39;s just a data science career guru with fresh perspectives. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0749481544/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=superdatascie-20&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=0749481544&amp;linkId=bb7507851a740c1eb7f45ab4b6bd2a84">Amazon link</a></li>

<li><p>Provost, Foster and Fawcett, Tom. <em>Data Science for Business: What You Need to Know About Data Mining and Data-Analytic Thinking</em>. O&#39;Reilly Media, Inc., 2013.</p>
<ul>
<li>This was a textbook for Foundations of Data Science, an UCI graduate course that I recently completed. Examples in this textbook are denser and math-heavier than <em>Confident Data Skills</em>. This would be most appropriate for anyone actively trying to move into a data science role. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Data-Science-Business-Data-Analytic-Thinking/dp/1449361323/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1537984955&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=data+science+for+business">Amazon link</a></li>
