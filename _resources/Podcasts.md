Outside of the classroom, podcasts help me stay current with data science news and local events. If you have any podcast suggestions that touch on analytics careers, data science, machine learning, or artificial intelligence, I'd love to hear from you!

* [Super Data Science Podcast](https://soundcloud.com/superdatascience): Hosted by Kirill Eremenko, the goal of the Super Data Science podcast is to bring you the most inspiring data scientists and analysts from around the world
* [Data Skeptic](https://dataskeptic.com/podcast?limit=10&offset=0): Hosted by Kyle Polich, _Data Skeptic_ aims to reveal the science of fake news
* [The Science of Social Media](https://soundcloud.com/the-science-of-social-media): Created by Buffer (social media account management and post scheduling tool), this podcast is great for understanding how data science is being used in marketing and advertising, and explores technologies around social media analytics
* [Linear Digressions](http://lineardigressions.com/): This podcast is great for students and practitioners, each episode covering the complexities of a specific data science topic, e.g., A/B testing and compliance bias, data privacy laws, text analysis (and tools like Word2Vec), computational limitations, AutoML tools, etc.
