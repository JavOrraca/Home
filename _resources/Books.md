* Eremenko, Kirill. _Confident Data Skills: Master the Fundamentals of Working with Data and Supercharge Your Career_. Kogan Page, 2018.
  * From the creator of Super Data Science, this was an easy "for fun" read, light math, and provides an overview of data analytics and careers in this field. I swear I'm not on Kirill's payroll(!)... he's just a data science career guru with fresh perspectives.

* Provost, Foster and Fawcett, Tom. _Data Science for Business: What You Need to Know About Data Mining and Data-Analytic Thinking_. O'Reilly Media, Inc., 2013.
  * This was a textbook for Foundations of Data Science, an UCI graduate course that I recently completed. Examples in this textbook are denser and math-heavier than _Confident Data Skills_. This would be most appropriate for anyone actively trying to move into a data science role.
