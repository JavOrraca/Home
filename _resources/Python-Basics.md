_Many online Python trainings were made when Python 2.x was standard. Python 3.x is the future of the language, so don't bother installing Python 2.x (syntax between the two is very similar). Ping me if you need help._    

* [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/): A plethora of Python IDEs exist, PyCharm just happens to be my Python desktop IDE of choice
  * The full version is $89 USD for individual users, but if you're an active student, you can download the entire suite for free.
  * You can download a free stripped-down community version but it lacks full web development, database and SQL support
* [Google for Education](https://developers.google.com/edu/python/exercises/basic): Google's Python classes (YouTube links below) are loaded with great content and three downloadable scripts that accompany the lessons - These will take you a few days to complete and if you have a second monitor, load the YouTube videos on your second monitor so you can pause and easily reference the instructor's syntax
  * [Google's Python Class (Day 1, Part 1)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKTZoB2Vjuk): Introduction and strings
  * [Google's Python Class (Day 1, Part 2)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EPYupizJYQI): Lists and sorting
  * [Google's Python Class (Day 1, Part 3)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haycL41dAhg): Dictionary and files
  * [Google's Python Class (Day 2, Part 1)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWyoYtvJpe4): Regular Expressions
  * [Google's Python Class (Day 2, Part 2)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKZ8GBKmeDM): Utilities: OS Modules and Commands
  * [Google's Python Class (Day 2, Part 3)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nn2KQmVF5Og): URLs and HTTP, Exceptions
  * [Google's Python Class (Day 2, Part 4)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcteAbMC1Ok): Conclusion
