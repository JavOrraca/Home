title: "Scatter Podcast Preview"

Super excited with the interviews I've been recording recently for Scatter Podcast (LAUNCHING SOON)! There are so many great data science podcasts that I regularly enjoy, I'm just hoping to offer a slightly different angle. I want to explore and share what "data science" means at different companies, what day-to-day life is like within those teams, and better understand what experiences and skills certain companies value for potential candidates in their analytics, insights, and data science roles. It has taken longer than anticipated to get this launched, but the first few episodes will be rolling out in March!

Here's a taste of the companies Iâ€™ll be speaking with:
* [Chegg](Link)
* [Databricks](link)
* [Google](link)
* [NeoGenomics Laboratories](link)
* [NYC & Co](link)
* [Pacific Life](link)
* [T-Mobile](link)
* [TBWA\Chiat\Day](link)
* [TensorIoT](link)
* [The Home Depot](link)
* [Uber](link)
