If you’re based in SoCal, I highly recommend a visit to Telestron. This is an immersive, futuristic light show put on by VTProDesign and GMUNK. I love the intersection of art+technology and these robots do not disappoint! “A pair of robot arms project light patterns onto each other and all surfaces of the room during a seven-minute show.”
