title: "Cloud-based Jupyter Notebook via Google Colab"
---

I only started learning Python in January but regularly use Jupyter Notebooks for all of my R-based projects. Last week, I discovered Google Colab... After spending 24-32 hours on it, I might be in love!

Colab is free, Google cloud-based Jupyter notebook environment for team collaboration. No installs required. Just send your teammates a URL and you're set! Give it a shot with uploading your own Jupyter ipynb files (or see link below). I'm REALLY hoping an R-kernel is eventually released for Colab, but this is great. Oh, and you get free access to Google's GPU and TPU accelerators. I recently did a school project in Colab, mainly to familiarize myself with Python and test out some descriptive stats, visualizations (matplotlib / seaborn), and k-means clustering (scikit-learn). If you have any questions or thoughts, let me know.
