Microsoft Excel's pivot tables and Google Maps... Obvious differences here, but both are driven by split-apply-combine methodologies that visualize data sets. If you want to enhance your big data analytical capabilities, learn R, an analytics and graphics programming language! The swirl R package is a free, fun way to learn the basics of R. If you have any questions, I'd be happy to help you get started!
