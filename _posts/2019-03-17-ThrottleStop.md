title: "Boost PC Performance with ThrottleStop"
---

**For Windows Users Wanting More Speed & Performance**
I've been puzzled as to why I felt a significant lag on my top-of-the-line laptop (especially prevalent with MS Excel - if you're a power user, you'd have noticed immediately). Turns out, it's "standard" for my system to throttle the CPU at 1.9 GHz. Using ThrottleStop (free), I removed CPU throttling for speed gains and undervolted the CPU/cache/GPU for temperature control. I'm running stable at 3.9 GHz and the improvement is night and day! R / Python / Tableau now run much faster.

*TWEAK AT YOUR OWN RISK!*... For hardware longevity, this advice is likely not the best, but for performance, absolutely! Research the settings that would be most optimal for your system and processor.
