Tableau's latest upgrade has a native natural language processing capability called Ask Data - Ask it a question in plain English ("What is the profit over time, by business line?") and Tableau "determines the most appropriate visualization to satisfy the user’s intent." Super neat, and I'm excited to give the upgrade a spin!

On the surface, Ask Data seems quite gimmicky... But as a starting point for visualizations, or for near-instant data investigations during a meeting, this feature looks awesome. I'm interested to hear your thoughts, especially if you've tried this out!
