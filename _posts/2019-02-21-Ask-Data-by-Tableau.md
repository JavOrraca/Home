Tableau's latest upgrade has a new built-in natural language capability called Ask Data - Ask it a question in plain English ("What is the profit over time, by business line?") and Tableau "determines the most appropriate visualization to satisfy the userâ€™s intent." Super neat, and I'm excited to give the upgrade a spin!

On the surface, Ask Data seems quite gimmicky... But as a starting point for visualizations, or for near-instant data investigations during a meeting, this feature looks awesome. I'm interested to hear your thoughts, especially if you've tried this out!
