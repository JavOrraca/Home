title: "Python for Business - FREE In-Person Training"
---

Interested in an instructor led Python crash course? I'm a board member for UCI's [Merage Analytics Club](Get MAC link) and we're hosting a 1.5 hour Python for Business training led by my classmate and extremely talented programmer and data storyteller, [Samira Kumar Varadharajan](GET LinkedIn Link).

We'll be walking through Jupyter Notebook and providing an introduction to 1) Basic Python libraries, 2) Better visualizations in Python, and 3) Machine learning via Scikit-Learn. This event is open to all (students and non-students), is free for MSA members, and only costs 5 bucks for nonmembers.
