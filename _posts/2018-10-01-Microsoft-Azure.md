Building and training ML models takes a ton of time. Microsoft's Azure can now automate several steps in your AI development process including "data transformation, model selection and hyperparameter tuning." Really impressed that Azure is making this tech more accessible and easier to use. If you have hands-on work experience with Azure and don't mind me asking you some questions, please message me, thanks!
