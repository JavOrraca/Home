DataScienceGO 2018 was a blast! Kirill Eremenko, Hadelin de Ponteves, SuperDataScience, Formulatedby, and all the crew/staff put on a great conference.... Career advice from business intelligence and data science executives, practical use cases for machine learning and artificial intelligence, data storytelling tips and visualization resources, LOTS of "secret sauce" from thought leaders, lots of networking (and lots of Pablos!)... It will take me a week just to digest my notes but I will share my favorite insights and resources. Looking forward to more of these in the future, and 2019 tickets already available (and heavily discounted at the mooment)!
