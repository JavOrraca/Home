Network visualizations can be useful for understanding entity and large data interdependencies. I've been using R and the iGraph package to explore network analysis and found this tutorial to be EXCELLENT by [Katherine Ognyanova](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kateno/). It takes a lot of time to build these network graphs and more time to interpret, but definitely rewarding when it provides insights you may have otherwise overlooked. The screenshot above is a network diagram that I made to represent Amazon product copurchases.
