title: "Wes Anderson Color Palettes for R"

Are you a Wes Anderson fan and regular R user? If you want a color scheme makeover for your R visualizations, check out this fun Wes Anderson color palette package by [Karthik Ram](https://www.linkedin.com/in/karthik-ram-93334954/). Great stuff... I just tried out The Grand Budapest Hotel palette for a correlation matrix (see below)!

Props to my classmate [Kaitlyn Drake](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kaitdrake/) for finding this gem!
