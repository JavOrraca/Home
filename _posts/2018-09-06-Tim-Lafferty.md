title: "Tips From a Data Science Consultant"
---

The data science community is super welcoming - It's been great connecting with professionals all over the world, meeting other beginners and helping each other out, sharing best practices and educational resources. I was excited to recently hear an interview with [Tim Lafferty](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tim-lafferty/) (Georgia Tech alum!) on the Super Data Science Podcast discussing life as a data science consultant. Really practical tips here (even bought Kirill's book, [_Confident Data Skills_](https://confidentdataskills.com/) after the listen!).
